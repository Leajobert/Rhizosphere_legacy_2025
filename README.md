For each dataset (16S and ITS), separate scripts are loaded, with the first script performing DADA2 analysis and the second script including all subsequent figures:
  __Figure 1:__ Alpha and beta-diversity analyses of field sample microbiota;
  __Figure 2:__ Top 30 microbial genera in the roots and rhizosphere of symptomatic and asymptomatic field rice;
  __Figure 4:__ Comparison of microbiota between healthy and disease rhizosphere mix;
  __Figure 6:__ Comparison of the microbiome between the rhizosphere mix and the rhizosphere of the next plant generation;
  __Figure 7:__ Transmission of rhizosphere microbial taxa and differential abundance analysis;
  __Supplementary Figure S1:__ Alpha diversity and rarefaction curves


The scripts for two figures have been provided separately as they are not specific to either 16S or ITS:
  Figure 3: Heatmap of bacterial and fungal pathogens abundance in healthy and diseased rice leaves and Supplementary Figure   S2: Heatmap showing the abundance of bacterial and fungal taxa in healthy and diseased rice leaves.
  Figure 5: Phenotype of new cycle rice plants grown on rhizosphere mixes derived from healthy or diseased field plants.
