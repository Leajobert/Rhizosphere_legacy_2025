For each dataset (16S and ITS) scripts are loaded separatly, with a first script for DADA2 analysis and the a script including all following figures:
  Figure 1: Alpha and beta-diversity analyses of field sample microbiota.
  Figure 2: Top 30 microbial genera in the roots and rhizosphere of symptomatic and asymptomatic field rice.
  Figure 4: Comparison of microbiota between healthy and disease rhizosphere mix.
  Figure 6: Comparison of the microbiome between the rhizosphere mix and the rhizosphere of the next plant generation.
  Figure 7: Transmission of rhizosphere microbial taxa and differential abundance analysis.
  Supplementary Figure S1: Alpha diversity and rarefaction curves

Scripts for 2 figures have been put separatly as they are not specific to either 16S or ITS:
  Figure 3: Heatmap of bacterial and fungal pathogens abundance in healthy and diseased rice leaves and Supplementary Figure   S2: Heatmap showing the abundance of bacterial and fungal taxa in healthy and diseased rice leaves.
  Figure 5: Phenotype of new cycle rice plants grown on rhizosphere mixes derived from healthy or diseased field plants.
